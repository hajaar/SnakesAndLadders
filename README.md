# SnakesAndLadders

Objective - I building a Snakes & Ladders game using UIKit to get better at Swift.


Game Synopsis - Normal Snake & Ladders with a bit of strategy thrown in.

Game Rules - Players can choose where to place the snake or ladder. Placing a snake or ladder will cause the system to
place the other automatically at a random location on the board. Players have only a limited set of snakes/ladders that they can place and each of them 
costs credits that the player will have to play. Players can earn credits by moving ahead on the board and by causing opponets to fall or rise on their
snake/ladder.
